We develop a framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), graphs, and humans to better profile news media sources (detect their factuality and political bias). Our framework performs better than using each approach independently: We outperform LLMs and graph models, and we need a lot fewer human interactions (less than 5) than having humans profile all news content.
