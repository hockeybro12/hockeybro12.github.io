I am a 5th Year PhD student at Purdue University working with [Professor Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2023. I have completed internships at Microsoft Research, Amazon Science, Fujitsu, and several startups (Loom.ai and UnifyID).

Broad Research Interests
======

My research focus is in the space of interactive learning and computational social science. I'm interested in building an artificial agent that can interact with humans to comprehend natural language instructions and use it to do better, especially without being re-trained. I have been working on solving this problem in [Fake News Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2021.internlp-1.7/), [Robotics](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1195.pdf), and Grounded Language Learning (paper coming soon).

General Motivation: While AI agents do very well, they can make mistakes, such as in tasks like commonsense reasoning, fake news detection, etc. Currently, when this happens, the model likely has to be re-trained. However, a human should be able to help it via natural language, and the agent should be able to take advantage of this knowledge to do better in the future, especially in a similar situation. Likewise, the agent should be able to ask relevant clarifying questions to get useful human help, so that it can do better. Enabling this would allow agents to continually improve when deployed in the wild, and be more interactive. I'm actively working on this and would be interested in continuing this direction at DeepMind.
