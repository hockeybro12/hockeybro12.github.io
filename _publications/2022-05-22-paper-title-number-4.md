We develop an agent that can interact with humans to solve challenging grounded language learning tasks. Specifically, the agent can receive "help" from humans as feedback, and incorporate it to perform better in other scenarios. Further, the can detect when it is confused and ask a relevant clarification question, which a human (or the agent itself) can answer, allowing it to perform better.
