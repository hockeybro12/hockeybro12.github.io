Graduate Work experience
======
* Summer 2022
  * Microsoft: Research Intern
  * Focus: Interactive Grounded Language Learning
  * Supervisor: [Julia Kiseleva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kiseleva-24842710/)
  * Details: Built an interactive learning solution for a challenging multi-modal NeurIPS Competition Task 
    * Our framework enables an agent to receive “help” feedback from a human operator when it makes a mistake. The agent also learns how to ask a relevant clarifying question.
    * In submission to ARR.

* Summer 2021
  * Amazon: Applied Science Intern
  * Focus: Interactive Product-Image Retrieval
  * Supervisor: [Emre Barut](https://www.amazon.science/author/emre-barut)
  * Details: Designed a graph-based, interpretable model for the task of multi-modal image retrieval: Given an image and an utterance describing a modification to that image, retrieve the target image from the database that has that modification
    * Approach achieved State of the Art performance on two challenging publicly available datasets (Fashion-IQ by 1%, Fashion200K by 5%)

* Summer 2020
  * Amazon: Applied Science Intern
  * Focus: Named Entity Recognition
  * Supervisor: [Michael Kayser](https://www.amazon.science/author/michael-kayser)
  * Details: Improved Named Entity Recognition on Alexa utterances with multiple entities by > 10% using gazetteers with neural NER models. Paper published at Amazon ML Conference
