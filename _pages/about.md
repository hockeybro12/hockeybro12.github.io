I am a 6th Year PhD student at Purdue University working with [Professor Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/), originally from California. I am currently looking for full time positions, starting in Summer 2024. I have completed internships at Microsoft Research, Amazon Science, Fujitsu, and several startups (Loom.ai and UnifyID). I have also published 5 first author papers (along with several workshop papers), and have been accepted at top NLP conferences like ACL, NAACL, and AACL.

Broad Research Interests
======

My research focus is in the space of interactive learning and computational social science. I'm interested in building an artificial agent that can interact with humans to comprehend natural language instructions and use it to do better, especially without being re-trained. I have been working on solving this problem in [Fake News Detection](), [Robotics](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1195.pdf), and [Grounded Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10750).

General Motivation: While AI agents do very well, they can make mistakes, such as in tasks like commonsense reasoning, fake news detection, etc. Currently, when this happens, the model likely has to be re-trained. However, a human should be able to help it via natural language, and the agent should be able to take advantage of this knowledge to do better in the future, especially in a similar situation. Likewise, if needed, the agent should be able to ask relevant clarifying questions to get useful human help, so that it can do better. Enabling this would allow agents to continually improve when deployed in the wild, and be more interactive. I'm actively working on this, and have published 5 first author papers in this area.
